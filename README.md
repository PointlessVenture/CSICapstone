# CSICapstone  

## Compliment Bot
The purpose of this capstone project is to create a bot capable of producing tailored compliments to images pulled from the r/FreeCompliments subreddit.

It utilizes a fine-tuned GPT-NEO model via the aitextgen tool, Microsoft Computervision to describe images for the model to give compliments to, and the Reddit API for getting images and compliment data for fine-tuning.

Colab Implementation (primarily used for fine-tuning the dataset):
